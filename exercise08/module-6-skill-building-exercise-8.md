## Double Your Money

Write a program that uses a **while loop** to determine how long it takes for an investment to double at a given interest rate. The input will be an annualized interest rate, and the output is the number of years it takes an investment to double. 

**Note:** the amount of the initial investment does not matter; you can use $1 as a starting investment, an interest rate of 7 percent and 10 years for the time period. Watch how your money doubles :-)
