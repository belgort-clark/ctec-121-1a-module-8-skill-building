## Prime Number Test

A positive whole number n > 2 is prime if no number between 2 and square root of n (inclusive) evenly divides n. Write a program that accepts a value of n as input and determines if the value is prime. If n is not prime, your program should quit as soon as it finds a value that evenly divides n.
