## Functions that Sum Natural Numbers

Write definitions for the following two functions:

- sumN(n) returns the sum of the first n natural numbers. Learn more about [natural numbers here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number).

- sumNCubes(n) returns the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.

Then use these functions in a program that prompts a user for n and prints out the sum of the first n natural numbers and the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers.
