```
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching one by one, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching one by one,
The little one stops to suck his thumb,
And they all go marching down...
In the ground...
To get out....
Of the rain.
Boom! Boom! Boom!

The ants go marching two by two, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching two by two, hurrah! hurrah!
The ants go marching two by two,
The little one stops to tie his shoe,
And they all go marching down...
In the ground...
To get out...
Of the rain.
Boom! Boom! Boom!
